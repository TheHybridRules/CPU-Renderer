# CPU-Renderer
A 3D renderer using the CPU.
Programmed using VS2013 in C++. 

This is a renderer which only uses the CPU. It was my first 3D rendering program for university which taught me the basics 
of how to render 3D objects. It doesn't contain any textures, lighting or even back face culling. 

To use:
Click on release file CPU Renderer (Found in the EXE Folder) - To open the application. 
Click on File and load to open up a file. -- There are 3 obj/txt files included. Robot, Teapot and Teddy*. 

*You can use your own but OBJ/TXT files must contain vertex and face information

Choose a file to render. 
Click on OK to load the file. 
Polygon image of file should be displayed. 

When you have loaded up a file and it is displayed. 
Q and W : Rotates the object on the X Value
E and D : Rotates the object on the Y value
A and S : Rotates the object on the Z value. 
O and P : To zoom in and out. 

R: Resets the polygon angles and zoom to it's initial state. 

Click on "face colour" or "edge colour" in the menu to change the colour from the pallete.
